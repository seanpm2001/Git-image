# Git-image Docs

## Installation

This file goes over the installation process of my Git-image repositories.

My Git-image repositories do not need to be installed to be used. They are merely a directory structure with image files and markdown documentation. The only programming portion is the project language file.

Depending on the project, project language files are just display files that can be executed in their native language. So many different languages are used that I can't document all of them here yet. I will start with a few:
