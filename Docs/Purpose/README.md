# Git-image Docs

## Purpose

This file goes over the purpose of my Git-image repositories.

### Artificial Intelligence usage

I expanded the scope of the usage of my image data in May of 2021, but didn't fully announce it until now.

I expanded the usage to include Artificial Intelligence to keep it in the GitHub theme, and because I have a pretty good Artificial Intelligence data set.

The images are also stock images, and progress images.

### Stock image usage

Originally, the images were to be used only as stock images and personal progress images. I have later expanded the scope.

### Why Git

Why did I choose GitHub to upload the dataset to? I slowly became more and more comfortable with GitHub and didn't know of a good alternative site to upload projects to. I felt it was best to put it all in one place.
